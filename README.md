# C++ Capstone: A Basic Feedforward Neural Network

This repo contains the code for the C++ capstone project for the Udacity C++ Nanodegree. I chose to build something to reinforce my knowledge of machine learning by implementing a neural network. I also wanted to practice modular C++ development, which is something I feel we did not get much of in the Nanodegree program. In the interest of time for the project, I chose to implement a basic multilayer perceptron/feedforward neural network.

The following resources were used as references in this implementation:
- [Artificial Nerual Networks](https://brilliant.org/wiki/artificial-neural-network/)
- [Feedforward Neural Networks](https://brilliant.org/wiki/feedforward-neural-networks/)
- [Multilayer Perceptron - Backpropagation](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417ml/MLP2/BackPropagation.html)
- [Iris Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)
